### API
As we are using Heroku as our PaaS, all APIs can be found here:
https://qalenium-api.herokuapp.com/listMethods

We're using Node.js + Express.js + Postgres as the backend stack.
To get started, you need to run the following command to start your node project and files:
npm init
(Follow the instructions to populate the package.json file)

To use Heroku we need to install it through CLI:
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku

Then verify installation running the following command:
heroku --version

Also, to run commands authenticated, youâ€™ll need to tun the following command:
heroku login

Hence, we need to push the changes to Heroku. To do so, we need to push our code using:
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push heroku main

To test it locally to see if it worked, run:
npm install axios
npm install express
npm install pg
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:dobby-dev
(make sure to update postgres credentials at index.js, see heroku postgres add-on ui page)
node index.js
Then, access http://localhost:8147 and validate if you can GET at /listMethods

Note that in order to access your app through the cloud server (https://qalenium-api.herokuapp.com/listMethods) your package.json file must contain the following start script:
"scripts": {
"start": "node index.js"
}


### Unit testing
All unit tests are being run against a Heroku machine as it is our PaaS.
